Learning Objectives:-
Perform a rolling update of the container version
Roll back to the previous working state


Problem Statement:-
Your company's developers have just finished developing a new version of their candy-themed mobile game. They are ready to update the backend services that are running in your Kubernetes cluster. There is a deployment in the cluster managing the replicas for this application. The deployment is called candy-deployment. You have been asked to update the image for the container named candy-ws in this deployment template to a new version, linuxacademycontent/candy-service:3.

After you have updated the image using a rolling update, check on the status of the update to make sure it is working. If it is not working, perform a rollback to the previous state.

Step1:- Create candy-deployment.yml file for deployment

candy-deployment.yml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: candy-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: candy-deployment-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: candy-deployment-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: candy-ws
        image: linuxacademycontent/candy-service:3
