Creating a Pod
In this video, we will start working with Kubernetes resources by creating a Pod.

Setup your environment:

mkdir -p ~/terraform/pod
cd ~/terraform/pod
vi main.tf:

resource "kubernetes_pod" "ghost_alpine" {
  metadata {
    name = "ghost-alpine"
  }

  spec {
    host_network = "true"
    container {
      image = "ghost:alpine"
      name  = "ghost-alpine"
    }
  }
}
Initialize Terraform:  terraform init

Validate main.tf:  terraform validate

Plan the deployment:  terraform plan

Deploy the pod:  terraform apply -auto-approve

List the Pods: kubectl get pods

Reset the environment:  terraform destroy -auto-approve

======================================================================================================================================================================================================


[node1 ~]$ mkdir -p ~/terraform/pod
[node1 ~]$ cd ~/terraform/pod
[node1 pod]$ vi main.tf
[node1 pod]$ ls -ltr
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 208 Dec 12 07:26 main.tf
[node1 pod]$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "kubernetes" (hashicorp/kubernetes) 1.10.0...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.kubernetes: version = "~> 1.10"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
[node1 pod]$ terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.

[node1 pod]$ terraform plan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
